# Coursework Repository

This repository serves as a structured archive of academic coursework, coding solutions, assignments, and mini-projects completed during my BTech in Computer Science Engineering (AI/ML).

It is intended to systematically document my learning progress, subject-wise implementations, and problem-solving work throughout my engineering program.
